# Solidity Warehouse

### Welcome to the Solidity Warehouse

This project is as of now in the beginner stages.

Here is how I see it taking shape.
This will be a hardhat project. 
I will deploy the contracts to Polygon Mumbai testnet,
and all the contracts will be verified using Etherscan API in hardhat. A very convenient way to Verify contracts.

In the end, the project should have close to a 100 contracts on various services like OpenZeppelin and Chainlink. The contracts will be segregated neatly, and the users will have a reach source of solidity code to help write their ow nsmart contracts.
